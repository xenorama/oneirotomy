		Manage HQ offline rendering of realtime audiovisual content
		</digest>

	<description>
		Written by Tim Heinze Â© 2020, www.xenorama.com.
		<br/> Synchronised with a render context hosted by <o>jit.world</o>, performs and manages a linear offline rendering process frame-by-frame. When used in conjunction with other related objects, tight synchronisation of realtime MSP and other timing events can be rendered in high resolution and framerates, respectively.
	</description>

	<discussion>
		This object lies at the core of every offline-rendering process in the <link type="vignette" module="Oneirotomy" name="oneirotomy-00_introduction">Oneirotomy-package</link>. It currently supports render contexts hosted by <o>jit.world</o> only, for reasons explained <link type="vignette" module="Oneirotomy" name="oneirotomy-03_known-limitations">here</link>.
		<br/> The object needs to be instantiated in the environment and provided with a valid context name. Should it fail to find any <o>jit.world</o> in the patch, it will craete one by the given ctx-name. Its functionality is disabled if only other contexts thatn the provided ctx are found.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Double-clicking the object or sending an <m>open</m> message will pull up a floating window as GUI to monitor, manage and toggle recording/rendering processes.
		<br/>All desired rendering parameters can be set manually, all of which can be hard-coded to the object box or sent as Max messages temporarily.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<h2>Version 2.0 Changes:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><o>the.jit.js.renderer~</o> no longer requires a physical connection to the target <o>jit.world</o> object, it instead can be dropped <i>as is</i> to the environment and will link to the named context automatically.</li>
			<li>The GUI is redesigned and there no longer is a <i>settings</i> tab</li>
			<li>Video preview is scaled as per output aspect ratio</li>
			<li><o>the.obj.init</o> is a new object, allowing for flexible attribute switches according to recording/rendering mode of both named objects or when connected</li>
			<li>The settings are more reliable and tightly-synced</li>
			<li>Any Gl-texture in the environment can be rendered instead of the main rendering window</li>
			<li>Widely used dimension presets can be selected from a manu</li>
			<li>The target diretory will always be that of the main patch when previously saved. When used in an unsaved patch, it defaults to the <i>testground</i> directory in the oneirotomy package</li>

				The word <at>length</at> followed by a floating point or integer value and a symbol specifying a unit, will prepare recording of all children objects for the given length.

				Supported units of time are
				<br/> <m>ms</m>
				<br/> <m>frames</m>
				<br/> <m>samples</m>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Default: <m>length 1000. ms</m>, if the current framerate is set to <m>30.</m> (see also the <at>fps</at> listing), this would yield a length of <m>30 frames</m> and would equal the current <m>samplerate</m> (provided in samples per minute = 1000ms.)

				The word <m>length</m> without any arguments sets the recording mode to 'free' and will not stop until the <m>stop</m> message is received in the leftmost inlet or toggled in the GUI.
				<br/> Alternatively, the arguments <m>free</m> and <m>fixed</m> toggle between an assumed performance mode and a fixed time, provided by the respective arguments in a separate message.
				<br/> Note that a lot of data can ptoentially be accumulated in 'free' recording mode when stretched extensively. This pertains to analysed signals, as well as regular timing data and especially matrix-based anylsis.
