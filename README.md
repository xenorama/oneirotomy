Tools for non-realtime Rendering of generative content in Max/MSP/Jitter
Written by Tim Heinze © 2020, [www.xenorama.com](www.xenorama.com)

## Purpose
Provide a set of objects which support offline, frame-by-frame, hiQ rendering of generative, ineractive content built in Max/MSP/Jitter. Designed to be implemented as intuitively as possible in any previously developed patching environment, limited only by the latter's complexity. 

## Requirements
Cycling '74 Max. jit.world context.

### Use and implementation
Add the objects in specific ways to your jit.world's rendering process in Max.

### Edit & Development
Advanced knowledge of Max/MSP/Jitter.

## Nomenclature
All objects carry names of anatomic—or related—terms pertaining to their inherit function in the offline rendering and rebuilding process of generative patches.

## the.prefix
«THe» are somewhat my initials: Tim Heinze.
Used to avoid conflicts between other people's abstractions and externals.
